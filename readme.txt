== Feature Summary ==

Simple:Press brings enterprise class forum capabilities to your WordPress site.  It makes it easy to get your forum started with additional powerful features available as you need them.

Built for performance with custom tables, it is tightly integrated into WordPress's user and security model and can easily scale up to thousands of users.

Unlike other Forum plugins, all of Simple:Press's features are built and supported by one organization - no need to contact multiple vendors when you need support for a feature!

And Simple:Press has hundreds of features!  Between the free functions and premium add-ons we likely have just about every feature you might need.

From multi-level forum structures to post threading and private messages, chances are that if you need a feature we have already built it.  13+ years of development has exposed us to all kinds of customer requirements and has helped us build a rock-solid product!

Import data into our forum from other forums including bbPress, Asgaros and others.  Get the importer [here](https://simple-press.com/downloads/simple-press-importer-plugin/).

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'Simple Press'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Uploading in WordPress Dashboard =

1. Download `simplepress.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
4. Select `simplepress.zip` from your computer
5. Click 'Install Now'
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Download `simplepress.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `simplepress` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `simplepress` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, you now need to run through a set-up process.  This creates the tables and default data that the plugin requires.
You can access this setup process by either clicking the INSTALL button that should be visible at the top of the admin pages or by going to FORUM->INSTALL.

At the conclusion of a successful install, a button will be displayed to load the forum admin and clicking on this will take you to the Storage Locations panel. All being well, all locations will be ticked as created and available but if this is not the case follow the instructions to manually create folders if necessary.

= Getting Started =
Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/getting-started/) pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've installed the plugin - now what? =

Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/getting-started/) pages.

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. The best thing you can do to diagnose email delivery issues is to install a plugin that shows you an email log.  We recommend MAILGUN or SMTP POST.  The logs will let you know if emails are being generated and not delivered or just not being generated at all.

= I cannot seem to create a new forum.  When I select a FORUM GROUP in which to create the forum, nothing happens. =
Use your CTRL-F5 key to refresh your browser cache for that page.  Sometimes old CSS and JS scripts just needs to be cleared out and CTRL-F5 does that.

= Can I import data from my old forum? =
Yes!  You can import data into our forum from other forums including bbPress, Asgaros and others.  Get the importer [here](https://simple-press.com/downloads/simple-press-importer-plugin/);

With a bit of development skill you can even [build your own importer](https://simple-press.com/documentation/importing-data/building-custom-importers/) for something we don't already have!  

Or contact us to build one for you or to use our flat-fee import data service.

= I am a WordPress admin but I can't see Forum menu items =
When a new WordPress administrator is created by another WordPress admin, the new WP Admin is NOT automatically granted rights to the forum.  Instead, an existing forum admin needs to explicitly grant the new WP ADMIN forum priveleges under the FORUM->ADMINS menu option.

One of the nice consequences of this division of security is that you can make a user a Forum Admin without making them a WordPress admin.

Upon installation, existing WP admins are made Forum admins; so this issue will only present itself when a new WP admin is created after the forum is installed.

= What shortcodes are available? =
Simple:Press does not use short-codes. Instead, it outputs the entire forum directly into the content area of the WordPress page you specify. By default that page is called FORUM but you can easily switch it to a different page in FORUM->INTEGRATION->PAGE AND PERMALLINKS.

= Why is the forum so thin? =
Many themes use a sidebar on their default WordPress pages.  This reduces the content area that the forum is allowed to use.  

Additionally, themes might designate a content are of only x% of the width of the screen.  

These two practices are the primary reasons why the forum might not look the way it should.  

However, the good news is that many of the higher quality themes provide a "full width" page template or allow you to change the default content area width of pages.  Contact your theme developer to find out if they have either of these two options.

= Can I charge for forum access? =
All the other reputable membership plugins use WordPress ROLES to control their membership.  Simple:Press forums does too.  So you can use ROLES to integrate with most other membership plugins if you like.  Just contact us if you need more help understanding what this means.

= Can I upload files to posts? =
The free version of the plugin does not allow file uploads.  But the premium version does.  The premium version also allow users to list, view and delete their prior file uploads.

The free version of the plugin can still display images that are stored elsewhere - just paste the link to the image into the post editor.

= The editor looks barebones - is there a better one? =
The editor in the free version is a pure text editor.  However, the premium version of Simple:Press comes with a full wysiwyg editor - the same one that WordPress uses - TinyMCE.
