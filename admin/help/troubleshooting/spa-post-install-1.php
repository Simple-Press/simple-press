	<p><b>Admins Menu > Manage Admins</b><br>
	As the person who installed Simple:Press you are the only forum Admin - which is different and independent from a
	WordPress Administrator. If you have other users you wish to be Admins or Moderators then we advise creating them as the
	first task.

	<span class="spaicon-Integration post-install"></span>
	<p class="codex-sub">Check your Storage Locations</p>
	<p><b>Integration Menu > Storage Locations</b><br>
	During the install, Simple:Press attempted to create several new sub-folders on your server under the 'wp-content' folder.
	If for any reason this was not possible then you may need to manually create some of them. Visiting the Storage Locations
	admin panel will quickly show if there are any problems to resolve.
